It is a bridge between a container and API interface. It also defines the permission of the model and each field. It automatically generates the CRUD API interface on the URL <code>/api/{model_name}/</code>, whose behavior can be customized by adding <code>prehandlers</code>.</p><h2 id="field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#field"><span>Field</span></a></h2><p>A field is a property of any item in a model.
